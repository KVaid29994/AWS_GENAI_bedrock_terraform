In **boto3** (AWS SDK for Python), you can interact with AWS services in two ways:

---7

### **1. boto3.client**

* **Low-level service access**
* Maps **directly** to AWS service API operations (like `list_buckets`, `put_item`, `send_message`).
* The methods and responses are **very close to the raw AWS API** (JSON-like dicts).
* You need to handle more details manually (like pagination, error handling, or building resource ARNs).
* Returns **dictionaries** (not Pythonic objects).
* Example:

  ```python
  import boto3

  s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

  # List buckets
  response = s3_client.list_buckets()
  for bucket in response['Buckets']:
      print(bucket['Name'])
  ```

---

### **2. boto3.resource**

* **High-level, object-oriented interface**
* Provides **abstractions** on top of clients.
* Lets you work with AWS services in a **Pythonic way** (resources and collections instead of raw API calls).
* Supports things like iterators, attributes, and resource methods.
* Automatically handles some complexities (like pagination).
* Returns **resource objects**, not just dicts.
* Example:

  ```python
  import boto3

  s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

  # List buckets
  for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
      print(bucket.name)

  # Get a specific bucket object
  my_bucket = s3.Bucket('my-bucket')
  for obj in my_bucket.objects.all():
      print(obj.key)
  ```

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect          | `client`                          | `resource`                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Level**       | Low-level (direct API calls)      | High-level (abstractions)           |
| **Return Type** | Dicts (raw JSON-like)             | Objects (with attributes & methods) |
| **Ease of Use** | More boilerplate, manual handling | More Pythonic, convenient           |
| **Features**    | Full coverage of AWS API          | Limited to commonly used features   |
| **Performance** | Slightly faster (thin wrapper)    | Slight overhead (object mapping)    |

---

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of thumb:**

* Use **`client`** if you need full API coverage, speed, or exact control.
* Use **`resource`** if you want a cleaner, Pythonic, and object-oriented style.
